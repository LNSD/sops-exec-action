# Use 'sops' to decrypt a file using an encryption key and pass the secrets to
# the given command.
#
# The encryption key information must be provided via environment variables:
# - SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE (or SOPS_AGE_KEY) - The 'age' key to use for decryption.
# - SOPS_GPG_FP - The GnuPG key fingerprint to use for decryption.
#
# NB: The "command" will be executed by sops as a sub-process: `/bin/sh -c "$command"`.
# See: https://github.com/getsops/sops/blob/d8e8809bf92a47e0b2f742b9a43c3ab713acfd6a/cmd/sops/subcommand/exec/exec_unix.go#L14-L16
#
# If the command fails, the error code will be propagated by 'sops', and it will print
# an additional 'exit status <status-code>' message to STDOUT.
#
# Globals:
#   SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE or SOPS_AGE_KEY - The 'age' key to use for decryption.
#   SOPS_GPG_FP (and optionally GNUPGHOME) - The GPG key to use for decryption.
# Arguments:
#   $1 - The path to the file to decrypt.
#   $2 - The command to execute.
# Returns:
#   0 - If the command was successfully executed.
#   1 - If the command could not be executed.
# Outputs:
#   STDOUT - The output of the command
#   STDERR - details, on failure
