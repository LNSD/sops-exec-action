## SOPS adapter functions using 'age' for encryption and decryption.

# Use 'sops' to encrypt a file using an 'age' key.

# This is an adapter function for 'sops' that allows providing the 'age' public
# key as an arguments.
#
# Globals:
#   none
# Arguments:
#   $1 - The 'age' public key
#   $2 - The path to the file to encrypt
# Returns:
#   0 - If the file was successfully encrypted
#   1 - If the file could not be encrypted
# Outputs:
#   STDOUT - The encrypted file
#   STDERR - details, on failure
